# BigKnob

This is an adaptation of the cool 3D printing project found at https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3d-print-an-oversized-media-control-volume-knob-arduino-basics/. 

The project is an exercise in 3D printing and microcontroller programming. In this version I have added a small strip of WS2812 LEDs. The LEDs provide light effects to match the media control. 

I created an animated gif to demo the Neopixel code in *oversized_volume_knob.ino*.
